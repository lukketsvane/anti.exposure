# Advent of Design

Welcome to the Advent of Design, where creativity meets the holiday spirit. Join me on a journey from December 1st to the 24th as I unveil 24 unique designs, one for each day leading up to Christmas. It's a celebration of innovation, aesthetics, and the joy of creation.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your creative showcase.
