## The AGI Shift: An Economic Overview
As AI evolves, particularly with generative AI advancements like ChatGPT, we're facing a potential overhaul in our economic structures. This brings us to the concept of Post-Labor Economics, which unfolds in four distinct phases:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Phase 1 - Early Victims** | Creative fields are the first hit, with the value of creativity dropping to zero. Clerical and administrative jobs are next in line. Key rule: Jobs that are forgivable and unregulated are most vulnerable. |
| **Phase 2 - Winding Down** | A transition away from human labor through shorter work weeks is proposed. This gives people time to adapt, find new hobbies, and redefine their lives. Companies have an incentive to automate more. **Recommendations:** Move to a 4-day, then a 3-day work week; encourage remote work to enable relocation to preferred living areas. |
| **Phase 3 - Safety Nets** | As total employment plateaus and drops, the establishment acknowledges the shift. Unemployment benefits and other tools are expanded. The rise of NEETs (not in education, employment, or training) signals the need for a new economic paradigm. Key milestone: Mainstream acknowledgment of AGI and labor market changes. |
| **Phase 4 - Post-Labor Economics** | Governments at all levels reconcile with this new paradigm. Implementation of Universal Basic Income (UBI) and Universal Basic Services (UBS) begins, probably starting with utilities. Redistribution becomes a necessity. |

### AGI's Potential Impact
Anton Korinek's article in the IMF's Finance & Development magazine suggests that AI's computational power has been doubling every six months. This rapid progress points towards AGI, AI that matches human intelligence, potentially within 5 to 20 years.

### Economic Implications of AGI
From boosting productivity to redefining the labor market, AGI's arrival could mark a dramatic shift in economic dynamics. The key is to adapt to these changes, ensuring shared prosperity and personal fulfillment in a world increasingly driven by AI.

### Redesigning Economic Policies
In response to AGI's impending impact, policymakers must consider adaptive systems for taxation, social safety nets, and monetary policies. It's about preparing for a fundamental economic transformation, not just minor tweaks to existing frameworks.

### Conclusion: 
The post-AGI economy represents a future where technology is the main driver of material abundance. As we navigate this transition, adaptability in policies, societal structures, and personal mindsets is key to harnessing the benefits of AI.
